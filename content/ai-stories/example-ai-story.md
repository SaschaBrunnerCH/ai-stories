## Overview

This is a minimal example entry showing how the AI stories board works, including an optional tile image.

## Story

### Context

We wanted to capture a short “what we did / what we learned” note about using AI on a real task.

### How AI helped

- Drafted a first-pass outline
- Suggested clearer wording for the final write-up
- Helped identify missing steps or assumptions

### What we kept human-owned

- Validating technical correctness
- Deciding what to share vs keep internal
- Writing the final story in our team’s tone

## What worked / what didn’t

- Worked: fast first draft and structure
- Didn’t: accepting “facts” without verification

## Reusable takeaways

- Ask for an outline first, then a rewrite.
- Keep the story short and concrete.
- Link to PRs, docs, or follow-ups when possible.
