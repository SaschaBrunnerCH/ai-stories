This is a minimal AI story entry that **does not** define `tileImage` in the frontmatter.

Use it to verify:
- The overview card still shows an image (the default fallback).
- The detail page shows the default image floated right.

## What happened

- Tried a prompt.
- Got an answer.
- Validated the result.

## Notes

- Add `tileImage: my-image.svg` if you want a custom tile.
